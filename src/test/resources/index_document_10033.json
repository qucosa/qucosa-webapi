    "PUB_ABSTRACT": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal atrophy caused by soluble amyloid β protein (Aβ) peptide \"oligomers\" and a microglial-mediated inflammatory response elicited by extensive amyloid deposition in the brain. We show that CNI-1493, a tetravalent guanylhydrazone with established antiinflammatory properties, interferes with Aβ assembly and protects neuronal cells from the toxic effect of soluble Aβ oligomers. Administration of CNI-1493 to TgCRND8 mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) for a treatment period of 8 wk significantly reduced Aβ deposition. CNI-1493 treatment resulted in 70% reduction of amyloid plaque area in the cortex and 87% reduction in the hippocampus of these animals. Administration of CNI-1493 significantly improved memory performance in a cognition task compared with vehicle-treated mice. In vitro analysis of CNI-1493 on APP processing in an APP-overexpressing cell line revealed a significant dose-dependent decrease of total Aβ accumulation. This study indicates that the antiinflammatory agent CNI-1493 can ameliorate the pathophysiology and cognitive defects in a murine model of AD.",
